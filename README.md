# Databases-and-SQL-for-Data-Science

The purpose of this repository is to introduce relational database concepts and help you learn and apply foundational knowledge of the SQL language. It is also intended to get you started with performing SQL access in a data science environment.

We will work with real databases, real data science tools, and real-world datasets. We will create a database instance in the cloud. Through a series of hands-on labs you will practice building and running SQL queries. We will also learn how to access databases from Jupyter notebooks using SQL and Python.
